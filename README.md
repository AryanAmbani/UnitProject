<p>This game is a doging game. Its a very fun and challanging. This took me a good 2 days to make. The main aim of the game is to doge the
blue circles. The sound effects did not work and i am sad that it didnt. <p>

<p>I was searching for ideas for a project when i saw ellipses moving and bouncing all around a screen i thought, hy not make a game out
of this. <p>
